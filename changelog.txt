v1.0 First release- should work propertly
v1.1 it didn't work :))- Changed GetExecutingAssembly() to GetEntryAssembly()
v1.2 simplified function/class names/ removed debug like stuff

v2.0 Added optional parameter to "read" method, that allows to read embedded files in lib itself !YOU MUST COMPILE IT YOURSELF! (GetExecutingAssembly removed in v1.1)
